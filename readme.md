# LiveMe Tools

This is an Electron-based app developed for searching and browsing of 
users and videos posted on the LiveMe platform.  Development is discussed 
on [TheCoder's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/A5p2aF4) along with 
feedback from users and any feature requests made.


## Getting Started

After you clone this project to your computer, run:
```
     npm install
```
This will install any required packages that aren't already installed in 
your local copy.

You will also need to manually install the node-m3u8stream module in my GitHub repo as it contains
custom code used in this project.  

### Installing

You can download the [latest release](https://github.com/thecoder75/liveme-tools/releases/latest)
